# DayMood
Over the course of around 100 days over the span of 4 months starting from february, I was logging different aspects of my life on a 1-10 scale. My initial goal was just to see if it would reveal anything interesting or potentially helpful in managing my life. 

I sat on this data for a while until I made this program in about a day or so. A lot of the code will probably be very scuffed so be warned, I just thought it would be cool to share.

### Metrics

I will share some of the more interesting graphs and data acquired, however, note there is more.
